# **nanoThallium** (ntl) - RISC ISA

nanoThallium or ntl for short is a reduced instruction set computing architecture __(RISC)__.  
It is a simple architecture I'm building for fun. It's meant to be simple to implement in hardware or software.

A FPGA-based implementation is planned.

There are multiple projects related to this main repository:

- [`ntl-emu`](https://github.com/AsuMagic/ntl-emu): The reference emulator
- [`ntl-samples`](https://github.com/AsuMagic/ntl-samples): Code samples
- [`ntl`](https://github.com/AsuMagic/ntl): Documentation and links (this repository)
