# **nanoThallium** (ntl) - RISC ISA

nanoThallium or ntl for short is a reduced instruction set computing architecture __(RISC)__, inspired by various architectures.  
The ultimate goal is to have a complete SystemVerilog implementation capable of driving video, audio and some other IO on the C5G dev board (Cyclone V GX starter kit from terasic).
